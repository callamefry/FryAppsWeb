              <p>I am a versatile and creative Unity developer, designer, and maintanence contractor with over a decade of hands-on experience in building games, apps and websites. Currently operating as the Director and Lead Developer of Fry Apps Ltd, I develop and publish original software while also taking on freelance and contract projects that span game development, full-stack web and mobile applications, and long term maintanence of those projects. I have a meticulous eye for detail and strong artistic background, picking up new skills quickly and problem solving are areas that I thrive in and enjoy a lot. 
              </p>
              <p>My background includes almost ten years of professional development experience, including a full-time role at Unit11 Apps (Robb Research), where I contributed to a wide range of educational games and applications. Since 2021, I‚Äôve been running my own independent development studio, handling everything from code architecture and backend systems to animation, UI/UX, and publishing.
              </p>
              <p>I am used to dealing with complex cross-platform projects such as Gooseberry Planet's safeguarding educational product, consiting of a Unity app and React website, deployed on WebGL, iOS, Android, and PC. This system integrated real-time database interaction using RESTful APIs and SQL, with AWS-based cloud infrastructure and carefully managed data security protocols to protect the sensitive user data of over 200 schools.
              </p>
              <p>I‚Äôve designed and developed multiple games from concept to delivery, both as part of a team and independently. These projects have allowed me to take on a wide range of roles‚Äîlevel designer, game logic programmer, artist and model designer, producer, animator, and sound designer‚Äîhelping me become a confident and well-rounded developer. In many cases, I‚Äôve acted as a solo dev, covering all areas of development, which I‚Äôve found both challenging and deeply rewarding.
              I‚Äôm an observant and compassionate person, which helps me communicate effectively within teams and take on leadership roles when needed. I continue to develop projects in my spare time and am currently working on a game I hope to release on Steam in the near future.
